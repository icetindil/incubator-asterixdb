The func_ref expression evaluates to a (generic or specific) function identifier, which may be the same as the function that the expression is a part of, thus allowing recursive function invocations. The expression labelled arg evaluates to an arbitrary object or aggregate object. The semantics of evaluating function applications was discussed in detail in section 2. For example, to set the name of a person, we evaluate the following expression   FunAssign(function name.person) (p1,'John')  In this example, the first expression is itself a function call, applying the function FunAssign to the function name.person (an example of a specific function reference). This returns the oid of the function that sets a person's name, which is subsequently applied to a tuple of two elements, the oid of the person and the new name (a string o...

The multidatabase system is a database system which integrates pre--existing databases allowing the users to access simultaneously database systems (DBMSs) formulating a global query based on a global schema.  The component DBMSs are assumed to be heterogeneous and autonomous. Heterogeneity refers to different user interfaces, data models, query languages, and query optimization strategies [5]. Local autonomy means that each DBMS retains complete control over local data and processing. As result of this, its cost model may not be available to the global query optimizer.  When a global query is submitted, it is decomposed into two types of queries [1]   -- subqueries, operating on sharable data items from local databases,  -- assembling queries, consisting of, CiteSeerX  2009-04-15 2007-11-22 2000 application/pdf text http //citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.33.8596 http //www.edbt2000.uni-konstanz.de/phd-workshop/papers/Josinski.pdf en 10.1.1.27.4704 10.1.1.51.8352 Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it." } }
